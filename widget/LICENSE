    "alpha" refers to Eric Bentzen's free Truetype chess font named
    "Alpha"; it is available at http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/fonteng.htm.
    "alphab" is the same, except that the black pieces have negative areas
    that are transparent rather than white in color. "merida" refers to
    Armando H. Marroquin's free Truetype chess font named "MÃ©rida"; it is
    also available at http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/fonteng.htm. "meridab"
    is the same, except that the black pieces have negative areas that are
    transparent rather than white in color. "uscf" refers to the chess
    font used by the United States Chess Federation and ubiquitous in the
    United States. "uscfb" is the same, except that the black pieces have
    negative areas that are transparent rather than white in color.
